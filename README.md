**Hi, this is my first release**
---
**DESCRIPTION:**

So what it basically does is disable the reticle whenever the player is aiming and moving, it's like better accuracy when you stand still in games, but with this script when you stand still, the reticle starts showing. It's standalone and it's my first ever release by the way so don't judge but tell me what i could've done better.

**[KNOWN ISSUES] (i have no clue how to fix them):**
- when you aim and run, then stop running, the reticle will show for couple milliseconds.

- The reticle is kinda flashing, not so visible but it is there.
